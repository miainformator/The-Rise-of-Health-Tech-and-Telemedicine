Health technology, or **health tech**, is reshaping how we access and experience healthcare. From remote consultations via telemedicine to wearable devices that track heart rate and blood oxygen, health tech is putting more power in the hands of patients and providers alike.

Thanks to AI diagnostics, real-time health monitoring, and personalized care platforms, the healthcare journey is becoming faster, smarter, and more connected than ever.

But with this digital shift comes an urgent need for **data protection**. Sensitive medical information is often exchanged onlineâ€”and a [**secure proxy**](https://the9proxy.short.gy/pricing-github-james2k4) is one of the best tools to keep that data private.
